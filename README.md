### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes! The labs introduced me to topics I have never learned before like Routing and showed me ways to use them.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would make my styling a bit better and add a feature to the cards that allows you to change the image.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I noticed some of my peers has color changing titles, which I would like to try next time!

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I would like to give a shoutout to Joy for helping me with debugging when I encountered trouble that blocked me.
